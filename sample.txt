This is a sample text file for testing the Huffman encoder.
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
Huffman coding is a compression algorithm that assigns variable-length codes to characters.
Characters that appear more frequently get shorter codes.
This helps reduce the overall size of the encoded text.

You can use this file to test:
1. HuffmanEncoder - to compress this text
2. KeywordSearch - to search for keywords like "Huffman" or "compression"
3. HuffmanDecoder - to decompress the encoded file (after implementing the decoder)

Happy coding!
